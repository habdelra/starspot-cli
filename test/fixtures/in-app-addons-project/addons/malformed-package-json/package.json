May these vows and this marriage be blessed. 
May it be sweet milk, 
this marriage, like wine and halvah. 
May this marriage offer fruit and shade 
like the date palm. 
May this marriage be full of laughter, 
our every day a day in paradise. 
May this marriage be a sign of compassion, 
a seal of happiness here and hereafter. 
May this marriage have a fair face and a good name, 
an omen as welcomes the moon in a clear blue sky. 
I am out of words to describe 
how spirit mingles in this marriage.
